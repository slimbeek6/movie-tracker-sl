## Description
 This application is a full-stack web application that allows the user to add a movie to their watchlist, move that movie to their watched movies list, and remove movies from a watched movies list. This database is global rather than local, so changes will not be temporary to a single server instance.

## Usage 
 This application can be used to save a movie, to remember to watch it later. This application also allows the user to mark movies that they have added to their watchlist as having been watched, and those movies will move over to the watched movies area. Once the user no longers needs to see a movie in the watched movies area, they can delete the movie from the lists entirely.<hr>
